# Introduction To Queue

A Queue is a collection of data structures that follow the standard FIFO (First In First Out) principle. in a queue, elements are added at rear or in order words,at the back and removed from the front. it works just like the real life queue.

## Queue Operations
A Queue typically supports the following operations:

- `enqueue(item)`: Adds an item to the rear of the queue.

- `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.

- `is_empty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.

- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

- `front()`: Returns the item at the front of the queue without removing it.
